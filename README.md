### Description
A  thesis based on this reposit repository.Eastablish the ransac process on the light field networks to reconstruct occluded images  
README_original.md is the original readme file.

change config.py for saving files root 
gpus:1  
sparsityï¼š64 to choose initial random image pixels  

In the experiment, the test is tested on each instance separately which means one file name in softras_test.lst. And the batch_size is set to 1 for one instance.
One instace can have multiple iamges with different poses.  
Note that the rec_nmr.py script uses the viewlist under ./experiment_scripts/viewlists/src_dvr.txt to pick which views to reconstruct the objects from. We have changed it to the index 0 for making the first file in data root to pick from easily.


### Command
typical command on gpus on the fau woody cluster:   
srun --mpi=pmi2 python3 experiment_scripts/ransac.py --data_root=path_to_nmr_dataset --dataset=NMR  --checkpoint=path_to_training_checkpoint   
--experiment_name=reconstruct_name --test_experiment_name=test_name --gpus=1 --sparsity= the number you want to sparsify(typical 64)
